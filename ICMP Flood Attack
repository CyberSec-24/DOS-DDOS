-> In this attack, attackers send large volumes of ICMP echo request packets to a victim’s system directly or through reflection networks. 

-> These packets signal the victim’s system to reply, and the large traffic saturates the bandwidth of the victim’s network connection,

-> causing it to be overwhelmed and subsequently stop responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests.

-> To protect against ICMP flood attacks, it is necessary to set a threshold that invokes the ICMP flood attack protection feature when exceeded. 

-> When the ICMP threshold is exceeded (by default, the threshold value is 1000 packets/s),

-> the router rejects further ICMP echo requests from all addresses in the same security zone for the remainder of the current second as well as the next second
