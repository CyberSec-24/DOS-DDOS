-> These attacks destroy a victimâ€™s ability to reassemble fragmented packets by flooding it with TCP or UDP fragments, resulting in reduced performance.

-> In fragmentation attacks, the attacker sends a large number of fragmented (1500+ byte) packets to a target web server with a relatively small packet rate.

-> Since the protocol allows fragmentation, these packets are usually uninspected as they pass through network equipment such as routers, firewalls, and the intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion prevention system (IPS)
