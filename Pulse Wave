-> Pulse wave DDoS attacks are the latest type of DDoS attacks employed by threat actors to disrupt the standard operations of targets.

-> Generally, DDoS attack patterns are continuous incoming traffic flows

-> However, in pulse wave DDoS attacks, the attack pattern is periodic, and the attack is huge, consuming the entire bandwidth of target networks.

-> Attackers send a highly repetitive strain of packets as pulses to the target victim every 10 min, and the attack session lasts for approximately an hour or some day

-> A  single pulse (300 Gbps or more) is more than enough to crowd a network pipe. Recovery from such attacks is very difficult and occasionally impossible
