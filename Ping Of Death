-> In a Ping of Death (PoD) attack, an attacker attempts to crash, destabilize, or freeze the target system or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using a simple ping command. 

-> Suppose an attacker sends a packet with a size of 65,538 bytes to the target web server. This size exceeds the size limit prescribed by RFC 791 IP, which is 65,535 bytes. 

-> The reassembly process performed by the receiving system might cause the system to crash.

->  In such attacks, the attackerâ€™s identity can be easily spoofed, and the attacker might not need detailed knowledge of the target machine, except its IP address.
