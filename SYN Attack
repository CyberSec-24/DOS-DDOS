-> In a SYN attack, the attacker exploits the three-way handshake method.

-> First, the attacker sends a fake TCP SYN request to the target server. 

-> After the server sends a SYN/ACK in response to the client’s (attacker’s) request, the client never sends an ACK response

-> In a SYN attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server (victim) with fake source IP addresses.

-> The attack creates incomplete TCP connections that use up network resources. Normally, when a client wants to begin a TCP connection to a server

->  A TCP SYN request packet is sent to a server. 
▪ The server sends a SYN/ACK (acknowledgement) in response to the request. 
▪  The client sends a response ACK to the server to complete the session setup

->  This attack occurs when the attacker sends unlimited SYN packets (requests) to the host system. 

-> The process of transmitting such packets is faster than the system can handle. Normally, a connection is established with the TCP three-way handshake

->  when Host B receives a SYN request from Host A, it must keep track of the partially opened connection in a “listen queue” for at least 75 s.

-> This ability to hold up each incomplete connection for 75 s can be cumulatively exploited in a DoS attack. 

The attack uses fake IP addresses, making it difficult to trace the source. An attacker can fill a table of connections even without spoofing the source IP address
