-> Zero-day DDoS attacks are attacks in which DDoS vulnerabilities do not have patches or effective defensive mechanisms.

->  Until the victim identifies the threat actor’s attack strategy and deploys a patch for the exploited DDoS vulnerability,

-> the attacker actively blocks all the victim’s resources and steals the victim’s data. 

-> These attacks can cause severe damage to the victim’s network infrastructure and assets

-> Currently, there is no versatile approach to protect networks from this type of attack.
